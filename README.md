# Prompt, Package, Publish!

This is a talk I gave for the [HSV.py](https://www.meetup.com/hsv-py/) python meetup on how I used AI coding agents to create the [sphinx_click_custom](https://github.com/rhettbull/sphinx_click_custom) package and publish it to PyPI.

Slides can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/RhetTbull/hsvpyppp/raw/main/prompt_package_publish.pdf)

Slides are created with [Deckset](https://www.deckset.com) which I highly recommend for MacOS users. It's a great tool for creating professional-looking presentations in Markdown.
